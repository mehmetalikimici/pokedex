# Pokedex

I created a pokedex site. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS.<br>

As seen in the design, I got information about pokemons from https://pokeapi.co using the fetch method. 
Then, I designed the information coming from the API and the information such as the types and weights of the Pokemon separately.
